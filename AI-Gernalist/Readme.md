# ðŸš€ Roadmap to Becoming an AI Generalist

---

### Build Once. Solve Anything. Stay Irreplaceable.

git ### ðŸŽ¯ Why Become an AI Generalist?

> 4 out of 5 jobs will be touched or replaced by AI by 2030. The best way to stay ahead? Become the person who knows how to build with it.
> 

An **AI Generalist** is like a full-stack builder for the AI eraâ€”someone who understands enough across domains (text, image, automation, product) to:

- Prototype fast
- Build useful tools
- Solve real-world problems
- Adapt to any future disruption

You donâ€™t need to be a coder. You need to be a **creative problem solver** who knows how to work with AI tools and systems.



## ðŸ§  The 5-Level AI Generalist Roadmap

### [**Level 1 â€“ Foundations of AI & LLMs**](/Level-1.md)

> Build a strong mental model of how modern AI works.
> 

ðŸ”¹ What To Learn:

- Whatâ€™s inside models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
- Core concepts: [tokens](/Level-1.md#tokens), [context window](/Level-1.md#context-window), [reasoning limits](/Level-1.md#reasoning-limits)
- [Prompting basics](/Level-1.md#prompting-basics-how-to-talk-to-robots): Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain of Thought
- [How LLM models generate answers](/Level-1.md#how-llm-models-generate-answers), [AI](/Level-1.md#-what-is-ai-artificial-intelligence) ,[Types of AI](/Level-1.md#-types-of-ai)

ðŸ”§ Tools: `ChatGPT`, `Claude`, `Perplexity`, `CustomGPTs`
